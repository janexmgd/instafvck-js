### Caution

<b>*Avoid Account Suspension*</b>

**Please be aware of the following risk before proceeding!**

This Bulk Downloader tool is designed to facilitate bulk downloads from various sources. However, there's an inherent risk associated with any tool that interacts with external websites, as it might trigger automated security mechanisms, including account suspension or IP blocking.

### Testing Environment

We have rigorously tested the Bulk Downloader in the following environment to ensure its functionality and reliability:
![savedLocation](docs/testingEnvironment.png)
- **Operating System:** Xubuntu 22.04.2 LTS x86_64
- **Node.js Version:** 19.9.0


During our testing, we downloaded a diverse range of files from different sources to simulate real-world scenarios. The tool performed efficiently and as expected, meeting our requirements for bulk downloads.

Please note that while we have conducted extensive testing, variations in environments and network conditions may affect performance and results. We recommend testing the tool in your own environment before conducting large-scale downloads.


By using the Bulk Downloader in your environment, you acknowledge that the tool's performance may vary based on factors such as operating system, network speed, and server responsiveness.
